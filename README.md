ESX | Simple Request Search Script

# Overview
This script was made for a dutch server, thus some stuff will be in dutch. As for the working of the script; it searches the nearest player, but only if they accept to get searched.<br>
The way it works: an armed player executes the following command; `/fouilleer` (dutch for search/pat down). The nearest player gets a notification saying someone wants to search them, and presents them with 2 options. 1: Accept to get searched, and 2: Decline the search request. If the player accepts, his inventory will become visible to the armed robber, via an ESX menu.
